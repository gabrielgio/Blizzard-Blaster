CS 328 Introduction to Computer Game Development Homework #2

Due: two weeks, before Tuesday's class (2/10/2015).
Part 1: Game Dev Platforms

If you haven't got any of the three Pongs working, you have to get one working in order to do Part 2 below.
Work with Dr. J to get at least two of the languages' Pong's working, since for your next homework, you will need to try a different language.
Part 2: Blizzard Blaster

Write a simple arcade game in honor of the winter storm Juno.


The premise is: you are shooting a heat ray into the sky from a mobile snowplow with a mounted heat gun that drives to and fro across the bottom of the screen, which represents a vital arterial street that it is your job to keep clear. Snow is coming in thicker and thicker as time progresses, but you can shoot the flakes if you can get under them. Your gun moves very quickly from side to side. If you fail to shoot a flake and it lands on the ground, it sticks, and the more snow that accumulates, the slower the snowplow's movement. The snowplow can maybe grind down some of the snow, and shove it off to the side, but it is a battle that you can never win. The game is over when the snowplow can no longer move.

You may use any of the three languages/game frameworks for this assignment.

Feel free to add your own ideas to your version of this game.
